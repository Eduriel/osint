# Forums / platforms search engines 

# Google Dorks method 
to monitor latest posts on forums that are indexed by specific search engines, 
we need to understand how they are structured 
in a forum or a blog / or other platform we can often see specific strings within the URL such as tid | threat | topic | blog | viewtopic and others. 

So what we do is, use this with google hacking in the following format 
~~~
inurl:tid | thread | topic | viewtopic | blog intext:leaked + db 
~~~
or any other intext \ topic you're interested in finding most recet mentions or posts of 
* set the time frame to last hour or 24 hours - depends on what you need 
* some results will be FP, as can be expected. but most will relate to different forums speaking about 
keywords such as leaked + db = indicated leaked database
* if you use more than 2 keywords, chances are to get less false positives.
